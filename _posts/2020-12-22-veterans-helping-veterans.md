Are you a U.S military veteran trying to land a <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/reference-materials/itmanagement.pdf" target="_blank">tech job</a> (or any job) in the federal government? 

Well, I'm not offering a job but what I am offering is my time and experience. I took the same journey as you back in 2011 when I separated from the U.S Army. I've helped coach several of my fellow veterans I served with land jobs, both officers and enlisted. 

You may be thinking, searching for a federal job is no different than searching for a job in th private sector, right? Yes and no, there are nuances to the federal merit system that makes it different than landing a job in the private sector. 

If you are up for it, please feel free to send me a note through my <a href="https://richardbright.me/contact/" target="_blank">contact page</a>. I look forward to hearing fom you!
