I haven't posted in awhile so I thought I'd spend a few minutes catching everybody up on my recent activities. First, I am no longer employed by the federal government! Wow, 10 years went by so fast. It was such an honor to have served in the various roles and organizations during my tenure. I started off as a Data Analyst in DHS and ended as a Division Director in GSA - and boy was it a fun and fulfilling ride. 

I am happy to announce that I joined one of THE BEST analytics and AI companies in the world - SAS! I am not new to SAS, either. I've worked with the platform from both a SAS developer perspective and as a platform administrator. For those other SAS admins out there, I can't say my time administering the platform was my fondest of years but it was fun - in retrospect. I learned a lot and grew tremendously - I think I mastered optimizing storage for serial I/O processing ðŸ˜€!

I am very grateful to be working for such a great organization and I look forward to posting technical articles about SAS, SAS programming, and about the two platforms I support - IIM and VI. 

Happy coding!
