I am preparing to take the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Associate Cloud Engineer exam this summer (target date no later than the first week of August 2020). Just wanted to provide a list of resources I'm using to prepare for the exam. 

### Books

* [Associate Cloud Engineer Study Guide, by Dan Sullivan - 2019](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Cloud-Certified-Associate-Engineer/dp/1119564417){:target="_blank"}

I am outlining the book via a [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NOZOEDP-74MHyuiMi7_meL7EsxuKszkhtt7KfcjER6I/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. Please feel free to send me a comment (or request for edit access) and/or use it as a study guide to help with exam preparation. 

### Online

* Linux Academy's [Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer course, by Ben Lambert](https://linuxacademy.com/course/google-cloud-certified-associate-cloud-engineer/){:target="_blank"}.

### Schedule your exam

* You can schedule the exam via the Google Cloud [webassessor site](https://webassessor.com/googlecloud){:target="_blank"}.

I plan to complete the book prior to beginning the Linux Academy course. 

I'll update this post as I progress though the material.

Thanks, and please do drop me a message if you have any questions and/or have gone down this path and have any words of wisdom that you would be gracious enough to share.
