I recently started the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" class="a" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> <strong class="a">Responsive Web Design Certification</strong> curriculum and wanted to provide some feedback of my initial thoughts. 

First, I thought the curriculum was well thought out and introduced concepts in small enough chunks that it would not overwhelm beginners. All the important topic areas are covered; from HTML5 structure, to CSS Flexbox and Grid, to a focus on accessibility, which is important for millions of users. 

Second, there is a good amount of applied activity as you progress through the curriculum, to include a capstone section where you develop 5 web pages using <a href="https://codepen.io/" class="a" target="_blank">codepen.io</a>. This was a lot of fun! 

I completed the Responsive Web Design cert yesterday and have started the Java Script section - fun stuff and a good refresher! 

I plan to update this post as I progress.
