**Update: 5/17/2020**

Although I think <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" class="a" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> is an awesome resource for learning front-end web development, I recently started working through the following books to help supplement my understanding a learning. In the end, sometimes their is no better way of learning than going through a book from cover to cover. 

Supplemental Reading in addition to completing the 
**freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification**:

* <a href="/assets/books/duckett.pdf" class="a" target="_blank">HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites</a>
* <a href="/assets/books/JavaScript_Up_and_Going.pdf" class="a" target="_blank">You Don't Know JS -- Series</a>

Enoy and happy reading!

I recently started the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" class="a" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> <strong class="a">Responsive Web Design Certification</strong> curriculum and wanted to provide some feedback of my initial thoughts. 

First, I thought the curriculum was well thought out and introduced concepts in small enough chunks that it would not overwhelm beginners. All the important topic areas are covered; from HTML5 structure, to CSS Flexbox and Grid, to a focus on accessibility, which is important for millions of users. 

Second, there is a good amount of applied activity as you progress through the curriculum, to include a capstone section where you develop 5 web pages using <a href="https://codepen.io/" class="a" target="_blank">codepen.io</a>. This was a lot of fun! 

I completed the Responsive Web Design cert yesterday and have started the Java Script section - fun stuff and a good refresher! 

I plan to update this post as I progress.

Thank you <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" class="a" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> for developing and providing amazing material!
