List of various books I've read or will read this year. Books I've read are grouped by month and pending books are listed under the parking lot section. 

My goal is to read a book a month. 

# January 

![essentialism](https://richardbright.me/images/essentialism.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

**Recommendation:** great book that helps put perspective on what you think is important in life or at work. I could relate to the first several chapters and I'm sure many of you will too. 

# February 

![Designing Delivery](https://richardbright.me/images/designing-delivery.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

**Recommendation:** if you work in IT, this is a must read. Jeff explains how promise theory, cybernetics and empathy can together better position teams/organizations to achieve self-steering - a term used to define teams that are able to continually support a product(s) based on clear alignment with customers and their needs. 

# March

Any recommendations?
