I recently started the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> Responsive Web Design Certification curriculum and wanted to provide some feedback of my initial thoughts. First, I thought the curriculum was well thought out and introduced concepts in small enough chunks that it would not overwhelm beginners. All the important topic area are covered, from HTML5 structure, to CSS Flexbox and Grid, to a focus on accessibility, which is important for millions of handicapped users. Second, there is a good amount of applied activity as you progress through the curriculum, to include a capstone section where you develop 5 web pages using <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">codepen.io</a>. 

I completed the Responsive Web Design cert yesterday and have started the Java Script section - fun stuff and a good refresher! 

I plan to update this post as I progress.
