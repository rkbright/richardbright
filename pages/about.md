I am a solutions engineer with 10+ years professional experience working for the federal government in the areas of information technology (project management, cloud computing and agency-wide IT modernization) and data architecture and analysis (data engineering, data warehousing, statistical software administration, and data analysis). 

I currently support the General Services Administration (GSA) leading the Infrastructure Capabilities Division under the Office of Digital Infrastructure Technologies. The division is charged with piloting emerging technology and assessing fit and value for GSA IT as well as managing projects and providing agile coaching support.
